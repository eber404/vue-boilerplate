### My personal Vuejs boilerplate

**Stack**:
<br />
- Vue CLI <br>
- Pug <br>
- SASS <br>
- BEM <br>
- Express <br>
<br>
The project has an express server to serve static files on Heroku. <br>
I also setup a pipeline to automatic deploy changes in master branch. <br>
<br>

*OBS: At the beginning, I setup this boilerplate to create vue web components, but for some reason that I have no idea, Heroku can't build multiple components per deploy... If you check the script "heroku-postbuild-ignore" in the package.json, you'll see the script I was trying to run in deploy... I added the sufix '-ignore' to make it commented, but if you want to clone the repo and try to deploy multiple web components on Heroku, you can just remove the '-ignore' sufix, then Herok understand the script and try to build all components in the path src/components/*.vue* <br>
